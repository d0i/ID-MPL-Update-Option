· In section 2.6 (Operational Considerations), the text is a bit
   odd. Why should a parameter set not be updated more often than
   twice the Information Refresh Time? Explain updated were (on the
   server by an administrator or ?). Also, how does the failure to
   refresh the option play with text in section 2.3 that indicates a
   missing option means to keep the previously communicated settings?
   Perhaps defining what “failure to refresh” means (i.e., I think
   it refers to lack of a DHCPv6 server response to a Renew or
   Information Request). Note also that Information Refresh Time is
   only applicable to Information-Request messages (see RFC 4242) so
   work may be needed as to how this this sections relate to
   Renew/Rebind? operations?

--> Update rate corresponds to RFC6206's operational consideration,
   and as it says RECOMMENDS I changed this to RECOMMENDED.

** Expected behavior on invalid option

   Also, from what I read in the rest of the draft, if an invalid
   option is received, that could cause the client to be removed from
   the MPL region. Could you clarify in the document what the expected
   behavior is if an invalid option is discarded? Is that like having
   no option? Is that pretending that the client didn't get one and
   staying with the previous option? It seems like it would be pretty
   easy to remove a client from the MPL region by flipping a bit. I
   would also like to see better clarification of how an option is
   considered invalid; while it may seem obvious, it's these details
   that impact interoperability. In the write-up, I don't see any
   indications that there have been interoperable implementations yet?

--> the rule is simplified -- any invalid is now ignored.
   (yes, we're going to make a network based on this and I'm working
   to fill the gap -- all ongoing, not yet tested such corner-case)

** clarification of time value

   Second, given that the meaning of the *_IMAX values is based on
   RFC6206 (as indicated in the update history) and that the *_IMAX
   and *_IMIN are confusing values, PLEASE have a reference to
   RFC6206.
